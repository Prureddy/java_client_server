#Java Client-Server Application 
This is a simple Java client-server application that demonstrates communication between a client and a server using sockets. The application allows clients to send requests to the server and receive responses.

Features
Client-Server Communication: The application establishes a TCP/IP connection between a client and a server to facilitate communication.
Request-Response Model: Clients can send requests to the server, and the server processes these requests and sends back responses.
Multi-threaded Design: The server is designed to handle multiple clients simultaneously using multi-threading, allowing concurrent client connections and communication.
Customizable Protocol: The application implements a customizable protocol for defining the format and structure of requests and responses exchanged between clients and the server.
Error Handling: The server includes error handling mechanisms to handle various exceptions and provide appropriate feedback to clients.
Getting Started
To run the Java client-server application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd your-repository
Compile the Java files: javac *.java
Start the server: java Server
In a separate terminal or command prompt, start the client: java Client
Follow the instructions on the client-side console to interact with the server.
Customization
You can customize the application according to your needs:

Modify the protocol: Update the request and response formats in the client and server code to match your desired protocol.
Extend functionality: Add additional features or logic to the server or client code to meet specific requirements.
Implement encryption or authentication: Enhance the security of the application by incorporating encryption mechanisms or authentication protocols.
